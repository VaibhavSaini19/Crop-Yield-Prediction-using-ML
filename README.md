# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-ML

A simple Web application developed in order to provide the farmers/users an approximation on how much amount of crop yield will be produced depending upon the given input. 
The application uses a Random Forest Machine Learning model, which was trained on over 20 years of data from 30 districts of Maharashtra, along with automatic live weather fetching for prediction. The model achieved 
an accuracy of around 86% and can be even further improved with more data.
